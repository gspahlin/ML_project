    <p>A disease dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/kumar9249/disease-prediction. 
      This dataset consists of 42 diseases, with 133 associated symptoms.  This page describes the results of Decision Tree 
      and Random Forest models used to predict specific diseases based on lists of symptoms.

      <h3>Decision tree </h3>
    
    <p>Python was used to develop decision tree models to predict diseases based on disease symptoms.  The datset was split 
    into training and testing sets, then decsion trees were generated based on the training set.  For this particular example
    The data was split 75/25 training/test.  A figure showing the actual decision tree as visualized using Fraphviz is shown
    at the bottom of the page.

    The accuracy for this model was
    training: 1.0
    test: 0.991
  
    A Feature importance analysis was done to show the relative importance of various features (symptoms in this case) 
    in the decision tree.  The results of this analysis are shown below.</p>

      <h3>Random Forest </h3>
    
    <p>Next the Random Forest algoritm was used to generate a prediction model. The Random Forest is a collection of Decision Trees,
      which are then averaged in an attempt to develop a more robust model.  The accuracy results for this particular Random Forest
      model were:
    training: 1.0
    test: 0.991
  
    A Feature importance analysis was also done to show the relative importance of various features  The results of this analysis are shown below.</p>
